A friend of mine recently went to the US to pursue his Masters degree, and he has asked me to help him decide between 3 phones:

[Samsung Infuse 4G](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SGH-I997ZKAATT), [HTC Inspire 4G](http://www.htc.com/us/products/inspire-att) and [Apple iPhone 4](http://www.apple.com/iphone/design/).

I used the internet to quickly compare the phones and had to suggest Samsung Infuse 4G. Hereâ€™s my response:

All in all, if you ask me, you should disregard the HTC Inspire 4G altogether. **Samsung Infuse 4G is the overall winner**, but if you want the Apple experience, go with the iPhone. Just remember that Samsung Infuse will come with Froyo (Android 2.2), not the latest Gingerbread (Android 2.3). But apparently, [Gingerbread for Infuse 4G is on its way](http://phandroid.com/2011/08/12/att-samsung-infuse-4g-will-receive-gingerbread-update-this-month/), so it shouldn't be an issue.

Look for reviews on YouTube if you don't feel like reading. Let me know what you've decided :)
