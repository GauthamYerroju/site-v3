Remember my post about [Stereoscopic 3D](http://gtmstechblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/stereoscopic-vision/)? I have processed more such photos on the occasion of my family trip to [Leh, Ladakh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leh). Use your typical red-blue 3D glasses to view:

If I had known theyâ€™d turn out so great, I would have made time to take more, which would really shine in 3D. To see how 3D works and how one might make 3D photos, refer to my post about stereoscopic vision. And I compel you to use Google and Youtube for really good tutorials. Until next time folks.
