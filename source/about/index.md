I am Gautham Yerroju, and geek is the closest thing that can be used to describe me in one word. Using this blog, I am attempting to profile my random experiments regarding computers and technology in general. All the time I spend on said experiments is otherwise wasted work perhaps, but recording it gives me a sense of satisfaction and achievement. With this blog, I intend make a mark for myself, even if it is a molecular stain on the canvas of history.
